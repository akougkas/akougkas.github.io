i am an assistant research professor in computer science at [illinois tech](https://www.iit.edu/computer-science), where i serve as the associate director of the [gnosis research center](https://grc.iit.edu). my work at illinois tech and as a guest research faculty at [argonne national laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs) involves developing cutting-edge data management and storage solutions. with a strong focus on high-performance computing (hpc) and artificial intelligence (ai), i lead innovative projects and guide the next generation of computer scientists. Always curious and ready to explore. <i class="fas fa-smile-beam"></i>
